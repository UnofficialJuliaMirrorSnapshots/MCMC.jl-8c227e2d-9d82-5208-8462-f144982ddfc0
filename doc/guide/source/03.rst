Variable NStates (Chains)
==========================================================================================

``Klara``â€™s ``NState`` type system is used for storing several variable states. An instance ``nstate`` of some ``NState`` type
stores ``nstate.n`` number of states, each of which share the same type. ``NStates`` are useful for saving the output of
Monte Carlo simulations. A Markov chain generated by a Monte Carlo algorithm consists of a certain number of states. An
instance of some ``NState`` type can be used for saving the simulated Markov chain. For this reason, ``Klara`` provides
``Chain`` aliases for ``NState`` types.
